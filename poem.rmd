## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves. 
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:  
All mimsy were the borogoves,  
      And the mome raths outgrabe.  

“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!  
      The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!  
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun  
      The frumious Bandersnatch!”

In realms of words where dreams reside,  
An artist's muse, I shall confide.  
With keystrokes dancing, thoughts entwined,  
A tapestry of verse, the heart shall find.  

In twilight's embrace, the ink shall flow,  
Unleashing emotions, a vibrant glow.  
Whispers of love, and tales untold,  
In this poem's cradle, they unfold.  

A symphony of syllables, like birds in flight,  
Each line a brushstroke, painting the night.  
Words bloom like flowers in meadows fair,  
Caressing the soul with tender care.  

Oh, the power of language, a magic spell,  
Weaving enchantment, the stories to tell.  
Through metaphors, we explore the unknown,  
A universe of feelings, through poetry sown.  

From joy's sweet laughter to sorrow's tears,  
Each verse a vessel, erasing our fears.  
Imagination's playground, where fantasies roam,  
Words set free, finding solace, a place to call home.  

The poet's heart, an open door,  
Inviting readers to wander and explore.  
Lines like rivers, coursing through time,  
Capturing moments, both sublime and prime.  

So let us dance upon this parchment white,  
Embrace the rhythm, let words take flight.  
For in this poetic tapestry we weave,  
The beauty of life, we shall perceive.  

With humble verses, we strive to impart,  
The depths of emotions that stir the heart.  
In this brief journey, a connection found,  
Through poetry's magic, forever profound.  

So let the ink flow, unbridled and free,  
Creating a symphony of words for all to see.  
For in this poem's embrace, we shall find,  
A world of wonders, the poet's mind.
